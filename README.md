The integrity of the data (i.e. facts observed) and the analysis (i.e. how the facts were interpreted) is what determines whether the conclusions drawn about a phenomenon (something we would like to explain) are true.
This is particularly true in scientific experiments, where usually no profit is made by the endeavour of drawing these conclusions, yet significant amounts of time, work and hence money are required in the process. Furthermore, understanding the results almost always requires a great deal of specialized training and hence may only be comprehensible and of interest to a small group of professionals at a given point in time. Yet the original data upon which the conclusions have been drawn may be of great significance many years down the line, by which point in may have been lost or in a format no longer supported.

It is this authorâ€™s belief that the afore-mentioned challenges need to be addressed by every scientist, and there are tools readily available to do so. The purpose of providing additional information online is so that: 

*	Data should be accessible and readable by everyone in any community and in the future,
*	The analysis should be available to everyone and expressed (in words, code or equations) so it can be reproduced.

For this reason, the data is being made available on GitHub, which has the following advantages:
*	Data can be accessed by anyone, anywhere in the world 
*	Data can be accessed freely
*	It is possible to update the data and discuss it on the platform, if more information is found
*	No changes can be made the data without everyone knowing
